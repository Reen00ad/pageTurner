## Scenario
#### A reader, Abdulrahman, eager to explore new literary realms, visits PageTurner's website. He registers with his email and creates a secure password. Once logged in, Abdulrahman heads to his profile settings, where he can edit his personal details to reflect his literary tastes. Excited to dive into a new book, he browses through the platform's vast library, finding a captivating title. With a click, Abdulrahman purchases the book and adds it to his "Purchased" list for easy access. Intrigued by several other titles, he adds them to his "Want to Read" list for future exploration. He selects a book from his "Reading Now" list and begins immersing himself in its pages. After completing it, Abdulrahman moves it to his "Done Reading" list, where he can leave a thoughtful review and rate the book based on his experience.

Abdulrahman also explores the community aspect of PageTurner, setting personal reading goals and following other users whose literary tastes align with his. Feeling inspired to connect with fellow readers, Abdulrahman creates an event inviting others to join him for a discussion on a recent favorite book. He can easily view all his previous events and meetings for reference and reminisce about the insightful discussions he's had.

Meanwhile, Ahmed, an aspiring writer, registers on PageTurner to share his literary creations with the world. After logging in, he navigates to his profile settings, where he adds details about himself and his writing journey. With enthusiasm, Ahmed uploads his manuscript and publishes his first book on the platform. Eager to connect with readers, he follows users who have shown interest in similar genres. He eagerly checks for reviews on his book, finding satisfaction in the positive feedback and constructive criticism from his readers.

Inspired by Abdulrahman's event, Ahmed decides to host his own meeting to engage with readers and gain valuable insights into their preferences. He can easily access a list of all his previous meetings, reflecting on the connections made and the discussions held, as he continues his journey as a writer within the vibrant community of PageTurner.
